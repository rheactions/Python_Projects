# print the below string in that specific format
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# 	How I wonder what you are!
# 		Up above the world so high,
# 		Like a diamond in the sky.
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# 	How I wonder what you are!


# print ('Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n  How I wonder what you are!\n     Up above the world so high,   \n     Like a diamond in the sky.')
# print ('Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n  How I wonder what you are!')


#okay this may get you the result but correct answer would be using\n for the new line and \t for tab

print ('Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are!\n\t\tUp above the world so high,\n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky.')
print ('Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n\tHow I wonder what you are!')
